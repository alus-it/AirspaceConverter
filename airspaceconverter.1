.SH DESCRIPTION
.B airspaceconverter
an open source and multi-platform tool to convert between different airspace and waypoint formats.
.PP
Can read airspace and waypoint files in the following formats:
    - OpenAir
    - openAIP
    - KML/KMZ
    - SeeYou
.PP
And the output can be done in the following formats:
    - KMZ
    - OpenAir
    - SeeYou
    - Polish
    - Garmin IMG
.PP
KMZ files are to be shown in 3D with Google Earth.
AirspaceConverter can take as input also SeeYou .CUP waypoints files and convert them as well in KMZ for Google Earth.
Airspace represented in 3D in Google Earth can help to visualize and better understand the airspace structure.
Not only, having the planned route or track of a flight (as GPX file), displayed as well in Google Earth will make easy to check for airspace crossed or to be avoided.
.PP
The PFM "Polish" format, (file .mp), can be used with cGPSmapper. This utility uses cGPSmapper to make the .img files for Garmin devices.
.PP
The output in OpenAir is useful to make the data from openAIP suitable for many devices which support OpenAir only format; in particular this feature attempts to recalculate arcs and circles (possible definitions in OpenAir) in order to contain the size of output files.
This software can also be useful for maintainers of OpenAir airspace and SeeYou .CUP waypoints files, not only to visualize airspace and waypoints but also to verify the syntax of OpenAir and CUP commands entered.
.PP
For the "landable" waypoints in the CUP files an estimation of the runway perimeter is drawn on the earth surface, in order to do that not only the position is used but also the runway orientation and length.
This is particularly useful to verify that the position of the airfield in the CUP file matches exactly the runway in Google Earth.
In software like LK8000 the airfield position is considered as the exact center of the runway, orientation and length are used to assist for landing with an HSI and glide slope indications; thus the correctness of: position, orientation and length becomes quite important.
.PP
AirspaceConverter can be used also to merge together several airspace files (openAIP repeated airspaces will be automatically removed) and filter the result on a specific range of latitudes and longitudes.
.PP
Converting openAIP files to OpenAir has also the advantage to reduce significantly the size of the total airspace database used on a portable device.
For example LK8000 recently supports also the openAIP format but it is not always possible to load bigger openAIP files on older PNA devices, while the same files converted in OpenAir yes.
.PP
There are also cases where the "official" airspace files are available only in KML format, also in this case is possible to convert it to OpenAir.
.PP
AirspaceConverter uses the same terrain raster maps (.DEM) of LK8000 to get the altitude of the terrain and so to convert altitudes from AGL to AMSL.
In case the loaded terrain maps are overlapping, the one with the best resolution will be automatically used.
On the LK8000 website there is a wide terrain raster map collection.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-q " " \fIQNH\fR
Specify the QNH in hPa used to calculate height of flight levels.
Default is 1013.15 hPa.
.TP
.BR \-a " " \fIterrainAltitude\fR
Specify a default terrain altitude in meters to calculate AGL heights of points not covered by loaded terrain map(s).
Default is 20 m.
.TP
.BR \-i " " \fIinputFile\fR
Multiple, input airspace file(s) can be OpenAir (.txt), openAIP (.aip), Google Earth (.kmz, .kml).
At least one input airspace or waypoint file must be present.
Additional input airspace files must be specified repeating the option \-i in front of each of them.
OpenAir input files are expected to be encoded in ANSI but if encoded in UTF-8 with BOM they will be also read properly.
.TP
.BR \-w " " \fIwaypointFile\fR
Multiple, input waypoint file(s) can be SeeYou (.cup) or openAIP (.aip).
At least one input airspace or waypoint file must be present.
Additional input waypoint files must be specified repeating the option \-w in front of each of them.
The waypoints will be used only if converting to KMZ or to SeeYou.
Hotspots files from openAIP are not supported while nav aids and airports yes.
.TP
.BR \-m " " \fIterrainMapFile\fR
Multiple, terrain map file(s) (.dem) used to lookup terrain heights.
Additional input terrain map files must be specified repeating the option \-m in front of each of them.
The terrain maps will be used only if converting to KMZ.
.TP
.BR \-l " " \fInorthLatitude,southLatitude,westLongitude,eastLongitude\fR
Output filter limits in latitude and longitude, it must be followed by the 4 limit values.
The limits are comma separated, expressed in degrees, without spaces.
Negative values represent south latitudes or west longitudes.
.TP
.BR \-o " " \fIoutputFile\fR
Output file, can be: .kmz (Google Earth), .txt (OpenAir), .cup (SeeYou), .img (Garmin) or .mp (Polish).
If not specified will be used the name of first input file as KMZ.
Output OpenAir files will be always encoded in ANSI.
WARNING: any already existing output file will be automatically overwritten.
.TP
.BR \-d " " \fIopenAIPinputDir\fR
It will convert all openAIP files in the specified directory. If used the options: -i, -w and -o are no longer valid.
All airspace files (*_asp.aip) will be converted to OpenAir, while all waypoint files (*_wpt.aip and *_nav.aip) will be converted to SeeYou.
.TP
.BR \-p
If writing to OpenAir with this option arcs (DA) and circles (DC) definitions are avoided.
So the perimeter of each airspace will be defined using only points (DP).
By default, without this option, arcs and circles are used even attepmting to recalculate them from points.
.TP
.BR \-s
When writing to OpenAir this option will make coordinates expressed in degrees minutes and seconds (DD:MM:SS).
By default, without this option, the coordinates are expressed in degrees and decimal minutes (DD:MM.MMM).
.TP
.BR \-t
When reading from KML/KMZ this option will make also the "LineString" tracks to be imported as airspaces.
In this case the tracks found will be closed and treated as unknown GND based airspace with ceiling at 1000 mt AGL.
Without this option, KML "LineString" tracks are ingnored by default.
This option is meant to import long lists of points (like state borders) so then the airspace definitions can be adapted manually in OpenAir files.
.TP
.BR \-v
Print version number.
.TP
.BR \-h
Print a short help guide.
